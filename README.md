# freidrd-final-project-alternate
## Original Final Project Failed
### This is the alternative final project for the final assignment for the Data Technologies Analytics class.
I had no choice but to abandon the original final Proect due to the totally unacceptable datasets.
It was too late when I realized that they were not going to be usable for the assignment.

## 🤔 Reflection
<!-- Examples for how you can reflect on this assignment --> This assignment really tested my skills and abilities brining together all the other classes I have taken. <br>
I made big mistakes that I had to revocer from and actully had to start over from scratch. <br>
This notebook is the result of my not giving up. 
<!-- * How long did it take you to complete the assignment? --> A huge amount of time.
<!-- * What do you think of this completion time? --> Par for the course, expected to put in the work.
<!-- * With hindsight, what would you do differently getting started with this assignments, now that you know what you know? --> I would have been much more careful about the datasets I would have choosen. <br>
I thought I had choosen good sets, but they were not that good at all. <br>
The only data set .csv file that was totally acceptable was the project excel file in the original project data folder in that notebook. <br>
And that .csv file, which was very thorough, would take a year if not longer to really analyze.


## Self-Evaluation:
<!-- Please fill out the following self-evaluation. -->
<!-- ⛔️ Make sure you account for any extra credit points you do in this assignment. -->
I completed everything that I could. <br>
I believe I have fully met the criteria of an adult audit student and I deserve a "T". <br>
If this was a real grade, at least an A or a A- would be fair. 

## Citations
<!-- Cite any resources you used in solving this assignment; This includes any individuals/classmates you worked with or sought help from -->
Far too many resources were used than I have space for. <br>
The usual culprits like StakeOverFlow, All of the Data sites, many references. 

## Assignment Comments
<!-- Take Aways for Self Confidence to do this Alone. -->
This was a very difficult class, and it was a lot harder doing it alone. <br>
We need to imrpove the collaborative enironment using social networks like teams, etc.
